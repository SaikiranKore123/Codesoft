# JAVA DEVELOPMENT INTERNSHIP TASKS
This repository contains the code and explanations for three Java development internship tasks:

## TASK 1: NUMBER GUESSING GAME**

- **Description:** Implement a number guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range.
- **CODE:**
- **Instructions:**
  - Generate a random number within the range (e.g., 1 to 100).
  - Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
  - Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
  - Allow a limited number of attempts for the user to guess the number.
  - Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
  - Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

## TASK 2: STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR

- **Description:** Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their marks in each subject.
- **CODE:**
- **Instructions:**
  - Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
  - Calculate the total marks by summing up the marks obtained in all subjects.
  - Calculate the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the total number of subjects.
  - Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.
  - Display the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

## TASK #: ATM INTERFACE

- **Description:** Build an ATM interface with options for checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing funds.
- **CODE:**
- **Instructions:**
  - Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
  - Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
  - Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().
  - Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
  - Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.
  - Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
  - Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.
