## TASK 1: NUMBER GUESSING GAME**

- **Description:** Implement a number guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range.
- **Instructions:**
  1.Generate a random number within the range (e.g., 1 to 100).
  2.Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
  3.Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
  4.Allow a limited number of attempts for the user to guess the number.
  5.Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
  6.Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

## TASK 2: STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR

- **Description:** Create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their marks in each subject.
- **Instructions:**
  1.Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
  2.Calculate the total marks by summing up the marks obtained in all subjects.
  3.Calculate the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the total number of subjects.
  4.Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.
  5/.Display the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

## TASK #: ATM INTERFACE

- **Description:** Build an ATM interface with options for checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing funds.
- **Instructions:**
  1.Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
  2.Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
  3.Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().
  4.Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
  5.Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.
  6.Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
  7.Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.
